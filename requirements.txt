# Fixes for https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/33552, https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/36228 
# merged into https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/36632, but we still experience the issue. An alternative fix 
# https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/33552#issuecomment-2880032963 states we should try v4.38.2 which appears to work for some cases
# @todo - occasionally check back in to see if the issue persists in the latest version of transformers
# transformers==4.38.2
# WE CANNOT USE THIS PATCH AS IT BREAKS THE PIP INSTALL!
# *** AFTER RUNNING pip install -r requirements.txt, run `pip install transformers==4.38.2`
